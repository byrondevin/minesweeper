# Minesweeper React Game

## Project Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It builds a game called minesweeper, in which the board (9x9 grid) is divided into cells, with 10 mines randomly distributed.

To win, you need to open all the cells except the mines.If you click on a cell that contains a mine '*', you lose.

The number on a cell shows the number of mines adjacent to it. Using these numbers, you can determine which cells that are safe, and which cells contain mines.
